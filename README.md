# Hello there 👋 ~~General Kenobi~~ 🤖
<p align="left">My name is Otávio and I'm a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> (with focus on Back End) and <strong>Full Stack Designer</strong> from Brazil!</p>
<p align="left">I'm a open minded and creative person, I'm always searching new and better possibilities.</p>

### Some facts about me:
<p align="left">
  💬  I speak Portuguese (my native language), English (advanced), and I am begginer in <strong>Japanese</strong>.<br>
  ✨  Values are very important to me, so I like to reflect and understand other points of view before making decisions.<br>
  📚  I have almost 10 years of experience in Adobe Photoshop and three in Adobe Illustrator 💻<br>
  🎸  I work with <strong>"Prog"</strong> and my biggest hobbie is listening to <strong>"Prog"</strong>. That is to say, I'm a Programmer who loves Progressive Rock. There's nothing better than coding for hours with a great progressive song!
